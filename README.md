- In the src/components/Header.jsx file, locate line 27, which should contain:

```bash
<img src={mempool} width={150} height={40} alt="Mempool-Terminal" />
```

- Replace mempool with the imported variable representing your logo. For example:

### Saving Changes and Pushing to Git Repository

After you have finished editing the website, follow these steps to save your changes and push them to the Git repository:

- **Save and Close Files**: Ensure all your changes are saved in the files you have edited.

- **Open Terminal**: Open the terminal or command prompt on your computer.

- **Git Pull**: Before pushing your changes, it's a good practice to pull any changes from the remote repository to ensure you have the latest updates.
  Type the following command:

```bash
git pull
```

This command fetches the latest changes from the remote repository and merges them into your local repository.

- **Git Add**: Next, you need to stage your changes for commit.
  Type the following command:

```bash
git add.
```

This command adds all the modified files in your working directory to the staging area.

- **Git Commit**: After adding your changes, you need to commit them with a descriptive message.
  Use the following command:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add new feature for meempol"
```

Here's the breakdown of the commit message:

- _feat_: Indicates that this commit introduces a new feature.
- Add new feature for XYZ: A short, descriptive message summarizing the new feature or functionality added in this commit.

You can use different prefixes for different types of changes:

- _feat_: New features or enhancements.
- _fix_: Bug fixes.
- _style_: Changes to code styling or formatting.
- _docs_: Documentation updates.
- _chore_: Maintenance or housekeeping tasks.
- _refactor_: Code refactoring or restructuring.
- _test_: Adding or modifying tests.
  Choose the appropriate prefix based on the nature of your changes.

- **Git Push**: Finally, you need to push your committed changes to the remote repository.
  Type the following command:

```bash
git push
```

This command uploads your local commits to the remote repository, making your changes available to others and updating the project's history.

By following these steps and using descriptive commit messages with appropriate prefixes, you can effectively manage and document your contributions to the project.

Remember to review your changes before pushing them and ensure they align with the project's guidelines and requirements.
